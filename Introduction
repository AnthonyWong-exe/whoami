Hi!

My name is Anthony Wong, and I'm a 19-year-old self-taught cyber enthusiast who has been interested in technology since childhood,
aspiring to find out how computers really work behind the scenes.

I started off with tutorials involving C++ and Python, grasping their purposes. Eventually, I stumbled across game development
and aimed to reach a level of professionalism where I could smoothly create my own video games, with the goal of discovering
bugs, understanding where they come from, why they occur, and how to patch them. However, as time passed by, I realized
cybersecurity was a better fit for my ambitions, as it allows me to properly execute my goals in a more practical way.

In 2023, I attended a cybersecurity boot camp, which boosted my foundational skills for both Red and Blue teaming. Shortly
after, I pursued and obtained the CompTIA Security+ certification.

In 2024, I aim to break into the blue team side of cyber and finally reach my ultimate goal of getting my first job in tech.
After that's complete, I'll be aiming collect more certifications such as OSCP or CySA+ to expand my knowledge and 
eventually reach a level of leadership!


ðŸŽ¹ One of my hobbies consists of playing the piano, in which I use YouTube videos to help with my development in music. ðŸŽ¹
